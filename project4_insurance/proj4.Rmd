# DATA EXPLORATION

In this assignment we explore, analyze and model a dataset containing 8,161 observations with 25 variables each representing a customer at an auto insurance company.  Two of the 25 features are target varibles and 23 are predictors.  One of the target variables, `TARGET_FLAG`, is a binary categorical variable where 1 indicates that the customer has been in a car crash and 0 indicates they have not.  The other target, `TARGET_AMT`, is a continuous numerical variable representing the payout amount if the customer was in a car accident. Of the remaining 23 predictor variables, 13 are categorical and 10 are numerical.  

Using this data, we will compose and evaluate several types of models with the following objectives:
- Logistic classification models that aim to predict the probability that a person will crash their car
- Multiple linear regression models that aim to predict the amount of money it will cost if the person does crash their car

The intended use case for these models is actuarial in nature: specifically, to calculate insurance rates commensurate with policyholders' (or policy applicants') potential risk levels, based on attributes such as income, age, distance to work,  tenure as customers, etc.

[JO: REWORD SO NOT REDUNDANT WITH ABOVE] 
[JO: DID WE CLEAN UP THE VARIABLE TYPES PER SLACK?]
In the training dataset, there are 23 predictors and 2 response variables - one is binary value that indicates whether claim was made and the other is numerical value indicating the cost of claim.

```{r t1}
knitr::kable(vars, caption="Data Dictionary")
```

[JO: CLARIFY WHAT WE MEAN BY APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION - CONSISTENT BETWEEN TEST AND TRAIN]
[JO: SHOULD WE USE A VISUAL HERE?  WHAT'S THE SECOND POINT GETTING AT?]

The response variable shows appropriate distribution in the training data.  We confirm that for the number of target flags are 0 equals the target amount 0.

## Summary Statistics

[JO: IN THE ENSUING SUMMARY STAT TABLES, SHALL WE REMOVE THE SCIENTIFIC NOTATION AND ROUND TO DECIMAL FOR READABILITY?]
[JO: WHY ARE VARIABLES SPLIT BETWEEN T2.1 AND T2.2?  DO THESE PERTAIN TO THE LOGISTIC AND LINEAR MODELS, RESPECTIVELY?]

```{r t2.1}
knitr::kable(summary.stat.num, caption="Summary statistics")
```

```{r t2.2}
knitr::kable(summary.stat.cat, caption="Summary statistics")
```

```{r t2.3}
knitr::kable(summary.num, caption="Summary statistics")
```

[JO: THINK THIS WOULD BE BETTER AS A SET OF SMALL MULTIPLE HISTOGRAM TABLES]
[JO: MSTATUS = z_F needs to be cleaned to F]

```{r t2.4}
knitr::kable(summary.cat, caption="Summary statistics")
```

```{r fig.cap="Numeric Data Distributions as a Function of TARGET_FLAG"}
hist.num
```

[JO: IN TERMS OF HIGHER LIKELIHOODS OF ACCIDENT, LOOKS LIKE COMMERCIAL DRIVERS, BLUE COLLAR, UNMARRIED (BECAUSE YOUNGER?), PARENT, REVOKED, MALE, AND URBAN.  IS IT WORTH LOOKING AT CONFUSION MATRICES?]

```{r fig.cap = "Categorical Data Distributions as a Function of TARGET_FLAG", fig.height=8}
bar.cat
```

[JO: IS THIS LIST BASED ONLY ON CONTINUOUS VARIABLES?  PERHAPS WE SHOULD BUILD DIFFERENT GRAPHS BASED ON SCALE - ONE FOR YEARS (CAR_AGE, TIF, YOJ, AGE), DOLLARS (OLDCLAIM, BLUEBOOK, INCOME, HOMEVALUE), AND OTHER (MVR_PTS, TRAVTIME - MAYBE SEPARATE?)]
[JO: WHY DO BLUEBOOK AND INCOME SHOW NO DISTRO?]
[JO: WHY INCLUD TARGET_AMT HERE?]

```{r fig.cap = "Outliers Boxplot"}
outlier.boxplots
```

[JO: DO WE NEED THE SCALED VERSION BELOW IF WE SPLIT UP AS ABOVE?  WHICH DO WE PREFER?]

```{r fig.cap = "Scaled Boxplots"}
scaled.boxplots
```

```{r fig.cap = "Linear relationship between each numeric predictor and the target"}
boxplots.target
```

## Linearity

[JO: DUE TO Y-AXIS, HARD TO TELL SLOPE - PERHAPS WE SHOULD ADD SLOPE TO THESE CHARTS TO BETTER DISCERN WHERE THERE SEEMS TO BE A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP?]

```{r fig.cap="Scatter plot between Numeric Predictors and the TARGET_AMT", fig.height=8}
linearity
```

## Missing Data

```{r fig.cap="Missing data"}
plot_missing(train.raw)
```

There are missing observations for a number of variables: `AGE`, `INCOME`, `YOJ`, `HOME_VAL`, `CAR_AGE`. 

[JO: SHALL WE INCLUDE A TABLE THAT SPELLS OUT THE MISSING PROPORTION FOR EACH VARIABLE?]
[JO: SUGGEST CHECKING THE OVERLAP BETWEEN MISSING VARIABLES I.E. ARE WE MISSING VARIABLES FOR THE SAME OBSERVATIONS?  ADDITIONALLY, FOR THOSE MISSING VARIABLES, IS THERE SKEW OR CORRELATION IN OTHER VARIABLES I.E. THEY'RE ALL MARRIED, HIGH EARNERS, HOMEOWNERS?]

[JO: ALIGNED ON DIGGING INTO ABOVE BEFORE MAKING QUALIFICATION BELOW?]
Given the low proportion, it seems acceptable to impute the missing values.

# DATA PREPARATION

## Variable Desc

#### KIDSDRIV
`KIDSDRIV` is a categorical predictor with values ranging from 0 to 4. It shows heavy skewness with most cars having 0 kid drivers.  Judging from the distribution, it appears that having kid driver results in higher probability of making a claim.

#### AGE
`AGE` presents driver's age and shows normal distribution, centered around 45.  Looking at the boxplot of age, there is no difference between the claim made or not in distribution. Therefore, we can believe that `AGE` may not be helpful in determining the probability of making a claim. 

#### HOMEKIDS
`HOMEKIDS` is a predictor describing number of children at home ranging from 0 to 5. 

#### YOJ
`YOJ` is a predictor describing years on job. It is believed that people who stay at a job for a long time are usually more safe. YOJ shows normal distribution apart from those who are unemployed. 

#### INCOME
`INCOME` is a heavily skewed predictor variable. The outliers should be treated.

#### HOME_VAL
`HOME_VAL` is a home value predictor variable. In theory, home owners tend to drive more responsibly. In the graph, we can see difference between the owners and renters.

#### TRAVTIME
`TRAVTIME` is a predictor variable describing the distance to work. Long drives to work usually suggest greater risk. However the graph shows fairly normal distribution and it may not be helpful determining the probability of making a claim.

#### BLUEBOOK
`BLUEBOOK` is a predictor variable describing the value of the car. The` boxplot shows that the lower value of the car, the higher chances of making a claim. It is a possibility that the higher price cars are driven more carefully. 

#### TIF
`TIF` describes how long the customer has been with the company, and the longer they have, the safer it may be.  The plots show the safe drivers tend to stay safe.

#### OLDCLAIM
`OLDCLAIM` is a predictor describing the claims cost made in the past 5 years. We can see that it is very heavily skewed and that most people do not make claims.

#### CLM_FREQ
`CLM_FREQ` is a predictor that describes claim costs in the past 5 years. It seems that people who have made a claim in the past 5 years are highly likely to make another claim.

#### MVR_PTS
`MVR_PTS` is a predictor that describes motor vehicle record points. If you get lots of traffic tickets, you tend to get into more crash. It appears to be a highly significant variable as seen in boxplots.

#### CAR_AGE
`CAR_AGE` describes the vehicle age. There is one data point that shows the vehicle age is -3, this will be corrected to 0. 

#### PARENT1
`PARENT1` describes single parent. This is factorized and renamed as `NumParents` to describe the number of parents. 

#### SEX
`SEX` describes the gender of the driver. This is factorized and renamed as `MALE` to describe male as 1 and female as 0. It does not appear to be significant variable in the box plot.

#### MSTATUS
`MSTATUS` describes the martial status of the driver. It is believed that married people drive more safely. This variable has been factorized and renamed as `Single` to explain married as 0, not married as 1.

#### EDUCATION
`EDUCATION` describes the education level of the driver. It is factorized. It may be correlated with INCOME.
	
#### JOB
`JOB` describes the type of job the driver has. It is factorized. It may be correlated with INCOME. In theory white collar jobs tend to drive safer.

#### CAR_TYPE
`CAR_TYPE` describes type of car. It is factorized. 

#### CAR_USE
`CAR_USE` describes how the car is used. Commercial vehicles are driven more and may increase probability of collision. It is factorized and renamed as `Commercial`. 0 means private.

#### RED_CAR
`RED_CAR` describes the color of the car is red. It is believed that red cars, especially sports cars are riskier. It is factorized.

#### REVOKED
`REVOKED` describes whether the license has revoked in the past 7 years. If it has revoked, it shows you are a risky driver. It is factorized. The boxplot shows the drivers who had lost their license are likely to be in accidents.

#### URBANICITY
`URBANICITY` describes whether driver lives in Urban area or Rural area. It is factorized and renamed as `URBAN`. 0 means rural.

[JO: THINK WE SHOULD DESCRIBE PURPOSE OF/ NEED FOR VALUE IMPUTATION.  MICE IMPUTATION ASSUMES 'MISSING AT RANDOM' (MAR), SO THINK WE'LL NEED TO ESTABLISH THAT THIS IS THE CASE.]
[JO: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE M AND MAXIT VALUES (1 FOR AGE, 2 FOR OTHERS?)]

## Missing values
```{r fig.cap = "Difference between original and imputed data"}
density.plot
```

We can see that excpet the `AGE`, the 4 variables roughly matches the existing distribution. We will use the 4 variables and impute `AGE` separately, using the median imputation.

[JO: THINK THE CORR TABLE GETS MUDDLED HERE DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF VARIABLES - WOULD WE CONSIDER JUST RUNNING A CORRPLOT?]
```{r}
corr.table
```

[JO: SHOULD WE THROW THIS CODE BACK IN THE SCRIPT FILE?]
[JO: WHY THE SUBSET OF VARIABLES HERE?]

Not surpisingly, higher levels of INCOME comes with YOJ; this also  means more is disposable, which shows correlation with HOME_VAL and BLUEBOOK.
[JO: HOW DOES CAR_AGE CORRELATE WITHINCOME?  IS THIS DUE TO HIGHER-END VEHICLES LIVING LONGER?  SEEMS SOMEWHAT COUNTERINTUITIVE]
Also, MVR_PTS shows relationship with OLDCLAIMS.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
corr.train <- train.num.a %>%
  dplyr::select(-TARGET_FLAG) %>%
  dplyr::select(-TARGET_AMT) %>%
  cor() %>%
  round(2) %>%
  corrplot(method = "circle")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::kable(corr.train, caption="Correlation table")
```

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height=6}
corr.plot
```
